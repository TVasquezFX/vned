# vned
This is vending machine in Java. It was designed using principles of object-oriented design and incorporated Encapsulation, Polymorphism, and Inheritance.

Products can be purchased by inserting the correct number of coins into the machine. A user selects a product from a list of available products, adds coins, and either gets the product or gets the coins returned if insufficient money was supplied or if the product is sold out. Products can be restocked and money removed by an operator.
