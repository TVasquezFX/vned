Exercise 2.18 from the book (p. 87)
Exercise 2.18. Design and implement a program that simulates a vending machine.
Products can be purchased by inserting the correct number of coins into the machine.
A user selects a product from a list of available products, adds coins, and either gets the
product or gets the coins returned if insufficient money was supplied or if the product is
sold out. Products can be restocked and money removed by an operator. Follow the
design process that was described in this chapter.
